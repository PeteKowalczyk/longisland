<p>To use funds in an employer’s digital account your organisation 
  <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/apprenticeship-funding-and-performance-management-rules-2017-to-2018">must
    have a written agreement and a commitment statement</a> in place.</p>

<p>The cohort reflects what's in this agreement. If you don’t recognise the employer that’s sent you the cohort request, 
  the cohort doesn’t reflect your agreement.</p>

<p>The cohort has been saved. You can choose to delete it or to contact the employer to resolve the situation.</p>
